# What is Base

The **Base Class** is a lightweight PHP utility library providing common functionality used across PHP applications.

It includes helpers and core components for:

- Environment variable management
- Request parsing (GET, POST, JSON, headers, cookies, files)
- Routing with middleware support
- Base controller with JSON and redirect helpers
- Response rendering (JSON, CSV)
- Authentication (Google OAuth2, middleware)
- Extensible utilities for building applications

Base is designed to be used directly or as the foundation for [BaseApp](https://github.com/Stilmark/BaseApp).

_TBD: Add diagrams and more examples._
